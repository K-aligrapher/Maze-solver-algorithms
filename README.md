# 🌀 Maze Solver Algorithms

A web-based visualization tool built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS to explore and compare different maze-solving algorithms interactively.

# 🚀 Features
- Visualize maze generation and solving step-by-step.
- Compare algorithm performance with metrics (speed, steps, efficiency).
- Interactive UI with controls to play, pause, and reset simulations.
- Built with modern frontend stack: React + Vite + TypeScript.
- Styled with TailwindCSS for responsive and clean design.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React 18 – UI library
- TypeScript – Type safety
- Vite* – Lightning-fast development & build tool
- TailwindCSS – Utility-first CSS framework
- Lucide React – Icon set
